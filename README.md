Smart-Survey-Boxes: Listening to Tajikistan
============================================

The code in this repository is based on the Listening to Tajikistan project. The purpose of the project is 
to monitor energy grid reliability for households by monitoring power failures. Hence the name **powermon**.
In October 2016, smart survey boxes were installed in 300 households. Since then, the boxes have been logging 
power failures and sending the data to a Google Drive server. This repository contains code for preprocessing the data, 
imputing missing values in the data and doing out of sample estimations.

Key components
----------------------
This project has the following components:

* Data preprocessing
* Imputation
* Out of sample prediction
* Satellite night lights integration
