If something is updated —> it is overwriting

When they change the address, the box id should remain the same, but the household id need to be created.

Boxes change within PSU... New observations for box 300... 

JP: Need to create household id

Outputs for dashboards: powerout.csv of csv and boxdetails.csv and boxes.csv (double check)


Data processing workflow:

01: xml to csv everyday - ok
02: prep data for imputation - ok
03: model train - ok
04: imputations - ok

What are we predicting: 
1 ping on
2 power on 
3 power off
4 ping off

•
timestamp used == datesent
•
adjustments on deviceid have been made 
•
dropped how many == 2056 events
•
sms2.shape = bound by min max
•
12 hour difference discussion, missing threshold to be 13 hours. are ping messages well behaved? do they come in exactly by the minute? should be. but we can check this.
•
on imputation: imputing hourly status and creating implied series of events
•
starting from 14th hour we say the event is misssing
•
JP: thinks problematic imputation approach pon_mon and pfail_mon are hardwired. should it carry on? if you have powerback you will be saying powerback,powerback,powerback,powerback,powerback. 
•
status is continuous, event is switching of status
•
JP: e.g. every day this box is going to convert from power on monitoring to power fail monitoring  ...
•
LONG LAT - clustering kicks in, Time - make a test ...
•
prediction of outages is a function of entropy
•
Tajikistan: some locations outages are managed, some are truly random. shows two cases what people experience. from person's POV: how predictable are the outages in each area? 
•
how does this thing changes through moving window. Dunstan: Actually, we can calculate entropy by box and my month. -- OK
•
Find an exogenous change? Rainfall data. Make a compelling arguments. Using weather forecasting to plan deployment of teams. Windgust...
•
Extremely randomized trees. Mode predicts monitoring hours well. How accurately XGTrees predict? Make tests by type of message / event? Try to run this just on the status on/off?
•
Will: What will the final version of the data look like? 
•
JP: How do we choose the model? Overall model, not per box.
◦
How different is accuracy by type of event?
◦
How different is accuracy by region?
◦
How different is accuracy by quarter? Oct-Dec Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun. By month?
◦
This is needed to use for different types of regions. Also, to inform their decision on what protocol to use. This is just breaking down 86% by region and month. Train model on all the data and test it on the region.
